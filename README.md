# Book-Recommendation-System
A Collaborative-Based Book Recommendation System is a personalized recommendation algorithm that suggests books to users based on the preferences and behavior of other users who have similar tastes. This system relies on the principle of collaborative filtering, where the recommendations are derived from the collective data of all users rather than analyzing the content of the books themselves.The key idea is that if two users have similar reading histories or have rated the same books similarly, they are likely to enjoy other books that their counterpart has rated highly. The system uses this similarity between users or items (books) to generate recommendations.
